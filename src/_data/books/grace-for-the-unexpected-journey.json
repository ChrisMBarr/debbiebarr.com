    "I wrote this devotional book out of a deep concern and compassion for dementia caregivers, recognizing their need for faith-based encouragement. <em>Grace for the Unexpected Journey</em> is unique among devotionals because dementia caregiving is a unique, more difficult kind of caregiving.",
    "A loved one's diagnosis of Alzheimer's or another kind of dementia almost always comes as a shock. Along with that diagnosis, spouses, adult children, and other family members find themselves embarking on a journey they never expected to take: caregiving.",
    "While many people provide care for a family member who is ill or elderly, caregiving for someone with dementia comes added heartbreak. Caregivers must witness the slow unravelling of the emotional bonds that connect family members to one another. As the person's capacity for emotional connection declines, and their need for physical care dramatically increases, dementia caregiving becomes an increasingly difficult journey. Caregivers often also struggle with many practical needs of their own: sleep deprivation, lack time for themselves, and the frustration of not having enough help and support from others.",
    "The 60 daily devotionals of Grace for the Unexpected Journey comfort caregivers though relatable stories about the common emotional and practical hardships of caregiving, such as anger, loneliness, weariness, feeling guilty, discouragement, and depression. The book helps normalize these emotions and encourages readers to draw near to God in all the stresses of dementia caregiving—because he alone gives deep <em>Grace for the Unexpected Journey</em>."
