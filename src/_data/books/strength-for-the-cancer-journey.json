        "<p class='lead'>This year, and every year, millions of Americans will hear a doctor say three words they never wanted to hear: &ldquo;<em>You have cancer.</em>&rdquo; These life-altering words will usher them into what one man calls &ldquo;<em>the club that nobody wants to be a member of.</em>&rdquo; </p>",
        "<p>If you are a reluctant member of that &ldquo;club,&rdquo; I want you to know that <em>Strength for the Cancer Journey</em> was written for you. I wrote it because, ultimately, there are really only two ways to journey through cancer: in your own strength, or with the help and strength that God supplies.</p>",
        "<p><em>Strength for the Cancer Journey</em> provides empathetic daily reminders that God is a very present source of strength for anyone facing the challenges of cancer. Its 30 devotionals draw upon the personal experiences and insights of actual cancer patientsâ€”my eight-member &ldquo;panel of experts.&rdquo; In each daily reading, their stories. along with Scriptural truths, help readers invite God into the realities, uncertainties, and frustrations of their own personal experience of cancer.</p>",
        "<p>While cancer is a journey no one wants to take, no one ever has to walk that road alone!</p>",
        "<p><em>Strength for the Cancer Journey</em> is a book for both patients and caregivers who want to engage deeply with God, looking to Him for daily strength for their cancer journey.</p>",
