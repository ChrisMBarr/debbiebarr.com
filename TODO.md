  - hover effects for books
  - fix Grace book height (all heights equal)
  - normalize book cover images
    - BG color or zoomed/blurred duplicate image behind it?
- browser testing

- Quotes
  - alternate quote font
  - When it is full screen, there is that trailing single word on a second line on the KLA, Forgiveness, and Season at Home pages. Is it possible to center the full quote on one line on just those 3 pages?
